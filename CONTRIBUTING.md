# Contributing to the Project Ignis script collection

Please keep all bug reports and questions on Discord; do NOT open an issue or pull request for this purpose.

External contributions: please speak with a member of staff in `#card-scripting-101` first. For new additions, the official card script project is restricted to staff, following the Greenlight workflow. This includes all OCG, TCG, prerelease, Speed, and Rush cards.

## Bug fixes
- The title should be a short description, including the name of the card fixed, ideally an action in present tense.
- Describe the bug that is fixed in the description in detail
- Add `Closes #xxx` if this pull request is meant to close a particular issue
- A replay or puzzle demonstrating the incorrect interaction and reference to correct rulings is helpful

## New additions to the unofficial script project
- A pull request should contain only one card, except in the case of very closely coupled cards
- The card script is named correctly and in the right folder, `unofficial/`
- The corresponding database entry is submitted to [BabelCDB](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis/BabelCDB/blob/master/README.md) according to its guidelines
- The title should be of the form `Add "Card name"`
- The description should contain a link to Yugipedia to confirm the script behaviour matches the card text
- The supervising staff members should be requested for review or tagged in the pull request
