# Contributing to the Project Ignis script collection

Please keep all bug reports and questions on Discord; do NOT open an issue or pull request for this purpose.

Reach out to us on Discord to learn how to contribute and start scripting! Before opening a pull request, please speak with a member of staff in `#card-scripting-101` first.

General format for pull requests:
- The title should be a short description, including the name of the card fixed, ideally an action in present tense.
- Describe the bug that is fixed in the description in detail
- Add `Closes #xxx` if this pull request is meant to close a particular issue
- A replay or puzzle demonstrating the incorrect interaction and reference to correct rulings is helpful
